		Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered officials to start mass vaccination with Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in Russia from next week. Vaccination with Sputnik V will be free of charge for Russian citizens.

		The news comes after the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. The Kremlin had earlier given assurances that Russians were first in line to be vaccinated, with Moscow also discussing supply deals with other countries, reported Reuters.

		Russia had earlier announced that the Sputnik V vaccine has 92 per cent efficacy. The announcement comes as Russia recorded 589 new daily deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday, reported news agency Reuters.

		One dose of the Sputnik V vaccine will cost less than $10 (Rs 740) for international markets. Two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is required for every person to be protected from SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, hence the cost of the Russian jab will be less than $20 (Rs 1480) per individual.

		The first international delivery of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine will be made in January. The Russian Covid-19 vaccine will be manufactured in India besides other countries, said the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is managing the global reach of the Russian vaccine candidate.
